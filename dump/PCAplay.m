% suppose we have a distribution of time traces
%
% one source of variation is translation and scaling relative to the mean
% close to the mean we can represent these as
% 
% (1 + a T)f and (1 + b D)f
% where f is the the time trace 
% and T and D are infinitesimal translation and dilation generators, i.e. 
% d/dt and t d/dt 
%
% if in principal component analysis we diagonalize the covariance
% matrix to decompose 
%
% f = sum_i c_i f_i 
%
% comparing to the above we see that f_i will be the mean, T acting on the
% mean (the time derivative of the mean), D acting on the mean, etc.
% 
% we can exclude these principal components and the remaining leading ones
% will give a basis for the more non-trivial variation of the time traces
% 
% it is then easy to check the distribution along those directions and
% cluster the trajectories based on that

% another
